# Team-Hackathon
This is a program we created for our computer science class. It includes a website where the user can access games related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals: Quality Education. The website also contains information about the subject to further educate the user.

A Quick Rundown of our Programs:
1. Website
  
2. Hangman
   
3. Quick Facts Game
  
4. Math Cart Race (C5)
  
5. Wordle
  
The Developmennt Proccess:
When we started our project we struggled with deciding on one goal and creating a program to approach the issue. Eventually, we came to a decision, choosing to create an informational website and develop some smaller games to go along with it.

As we made more progress, we faced many challenges and learned new skills to overcome them. For the development of C5, we struggled with looping the background, specifically the yellow lines on the road. Eventually, we discovered that modular division allowed for the lines to reposition themselves once they were off screen Throughout the website's development procces we learned how to add interactive elements such as buttons.
//add button
//interactive elemnts

//work toward creating a backend and more interactive elemnts on the website and more games
//we could polish the games more

. I used that as my base code and refactored it into my own creation.
