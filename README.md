# Team-Hackathon
  This is a program we created for our computer science class. It includes a website where the user can access games related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals: Quality Education. The website also contains information about the subject to further educate the user.

A Quick Rundown of our Programs:
1. Website
  The website is coded using HTML, JavaScript and React to create a platform where we can share and spread awareness and information about our UN goal. It is also the platform where we have added our games and where they are being shared to everyone.
  
2. Hangman
  This is a game of hangman where each word is related to a quality education fact. Once the user has won 3 games they win the game and after  each round a fact about quality education is displayed.
   
3. Math Game
  Answer math questions and learn facts about education!
  
4. Math Cart Race (C5)
  A game that has you race against a race cart to the finish line by answering math questions to speed past your opponent.
  
5. Wordle
  A game where you must guess a five letter word and have six guesses to do so.
  
The Developmennt Proccess:
  When we started our project we struggled with deciding on one goal and creating a program to approach the issue. Eventually, we came to a decision, choosing to create an informational website and develop some smaller games to go along with it.

  As we made more progress, we faced many challenges and learned new skills to overcome them. For the development of C5, we struggled with looping the background, specifically the yellow lines on the road. Eventually, we discovered that modular division allowed for the lines to reposition themselves once they were off screen. When creating the Math Game we had trouble with returning and retrieving values in function and having them work together to complete a specific task. Meanwhile, throughout the website's development procces we learned how to add interactive elements such as buttons. In general, we learned how to solve and pinpoint these problems through the use of debugging and testing our code.

Next Steps:
  Possible future improvements for our programs include working towards creating a backend and database to store user data, adding more interactive elemnts and games related to quality education and polishing our code further to make them more efficient.
